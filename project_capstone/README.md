# Capstone Project: Twitter Disaster Detection

### About

This repository is for the Capstone Project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

### Motivation
As a Capstone Project of the Udacity Course, I decided to work with text data. The Kaggle competition, [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started), is a nice project for NLP beginners like me. 

### Content

- data: original data
- notebooks: jupyter notebooks (all scripts were run in the Kaggle platform)
- requirements.txt: used python packages

### Instructions
1. Open the notebook locally or on the Kaggle platform. 
 
2. If you run it locally, run the following command in the project's root directory to install the required packages.
    ```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   I highly recommend you to use virtual environment in order to separate this environment from your core python environment. For example,
    `python venv -m env`
 
3. If you imported the notebook to the Kaggle, just click 'run all'
