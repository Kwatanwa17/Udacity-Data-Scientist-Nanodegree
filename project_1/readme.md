# Project 1: 

## About this Repository

This repository contains the notebook for the project 1.  

## Content

- seattle-airbnb.ipynb: jupyter notebook of analysis and visualization

## Project Motivation

As a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, I selected the Seattle Airbnb Dataset from Kaggle to analyse and visualize.

After I looked it over, I set 3 questions:

1. Is it possible to predict the price of a given room or apartment by using other variables ?
2. How is the availability of rooms and houses throughout the year in Seattle ?
3. And how the mean price does move through out the year ?

## Dataset Information

- listings.csv: list of Airbnb accommodations in Seattle  
- calender.scv: availability and price of accommodations of Airbnb in Seattle between January 2016 and January 2017 (365 days)

## Results

1. It is difficult to select relevant features that may affect the price of accommodations. It needs to be focus on how can be improved the price prediction model.
2. The availability of accommodations is surprisingly registered the lowest value in the summer. In general, the summer is high season and may tourists travels.
3. The mean price seems to be moving according to the public demand. More investigations are required to reveal other factors.
